Basics With React Native

Npm: 6.11.3
React Native CLI: 2.0.1
React Native: 0.59.8

You can see How to use React Native Navigation (StackNavigator) for browse between screens. 
You can see How to use View, Text, Image, Button, FlatList in the screens.
And the last one is how to create custom component and use it screen. 

In the App.js -> How to use navigation. 
In the ./src/screens/HomeScreen.js -> How to use Text, Buttons and navigate to other screens with buttons.
In the ./src/screens/ComponenetsScreen.js -> How to use View, Texts and constant component.
In the ./src/screens/ListScreen.js -> How to use FlatList.
In the ./src/screens/ImageScreen.js -> How to add custom component to screen and use its props.
In the ./src/component/ImageDetail.js -> How to create custom component. 

Good luck.
